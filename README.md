A bunch of German Alexa skills I made in late 2017 / early 2018 to get free stuff from Amazon.

I had so much stuff that I had to start throwing it away. That's when my Alexa Skill Developer career ended.
The sweater was too uncomfortable, the jackets were too big but I still love my Amazon socks. 
Unfortunately they stopped giving away socks. Would've loved me another pair of Amazon socks.

Oh and look at that glorious Amazon Alexa Christmas Ornament. Brilliant!
