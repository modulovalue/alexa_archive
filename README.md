# alexa_archive

A bunch of German Alexa skills I made in late 2017 / early 2018 to get free stuff from Amazon.

I had so much stuff that I had to start throwing it away. That's when my alexa skill developer career ended.
The sweater was too uncomfortable, the jackets were too big but I still love my Amazon socks. 
Unfortunately they stopped giving away socks. Would've loved me another pair of Amazon socks.
Oh and the Amazon Alexa Christmas Ornament, how can I forget about that.
